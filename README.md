# ***NeoJS*** is a 'JavaScript' scriptable NeoPixel LED Controller with an easy to use Web UI

## What is ***NodeJS*** ?

#### For the End User - *(Release)*
***NeoJS*** is a ‘JavaScript’ scriptable NeoPixel LED Controller that can be used by beginners and experts to learn, test, prototype, experiment with, and deploy NeoPixel addressable LEDs and LED patterns. 

***NeoJS*** has an easy to use web UI accessible from a standard web browser, over a standard WiFi connection. With ***NeoJS***, there’s no need to install software or hardware drivers on your computer or device to use it. ‘Out-of-the-Box’ ***NeoJS*** has everything needed to connect, control, program, and edit files using only the web browser.

:mortar_board: ***NeoJS*** is an educational ‘Toy’ that can be used by educators to teach programming skills using a fun, interactive, easy to use platform. 

:art: ***NeoJS*** is a tool or a resource for artist, technicians, or anyone wanting to rapidly develop LED installaions. Unlike other 'LED Controller' ... **change me to not put down something else**
  
  
#### For the Developer - *(Source)*
***NeoJS*** is also a Arduino Sketch demonstrating the use of a script (VM) interpreter (Elk JavaScript) from within the Arduino Development Environment (IDE). ***NeoJS*** leverages the Arduino development environment and several well known and tested Arduino Drivers/Libraries to create a JavaScript scriptable NeoPixel LED Controller with WiFi Access, Web Configuration, a Web JavaScript Editor (to edit the patterns), and a ‘Live’ Web (or Serial) REPL to interact with the VM. 

## Status
Right now things are still very much in the ‘just hacked together’ … ‘prototype’ … ‘proof of concept’ … stages 

However, this is one of the points we are trying to demonstrate with this project. We want to show how adding a VM layer into an Arduino sketch not only changes the dynamics of the sketch, (by making it scriptable) but also allows us to maintain access to the vast collection of Arduino Libraries and Drivers available.

## Why’s? And Why Not’s?
