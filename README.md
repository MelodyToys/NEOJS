#### For the End User - [*(Release)*](https://github.com/MelodyToys/NEOJS/releases)
**NEOJS** is a scriptable LED Controller that can be used by beginners and experts to learn, test, prototype, experiment, and deploy NeoPixel addressable LEDs and LED patterns, using a web UI with a standard web browser, over regular WiFi.

There’s no need to install software or drivers on your computer or device to get started. Everything needed to connect, control, program, and edit files is available ‘Out-of-the-Box’ using only your web browser. 

Educators use NEOJS as an educational ‘Toy’ to teach programming skills using a fun, interactive, easy to use platform. With features like the 'live' repl and the multi-user web UI, NEOJS provides a collaborative classroom environment that connects teachers and students like never before.

Use as a tool or a resource by artist, technicians, or anyone wanting to rapidly develop and deploy LED installaions.
  
#### For the Developer - [*(Source)*](https://github.com/MelodyToys/NEOJS)
**NEOJS** is also a Arduino Sketch that demonstrates the use of a script interpreter [(Elk JavaScript VM)](https://github.com/cesanta/elk) from within the Arduino Development Environment (IDE). Leveraging the Arduino development environment and several well known and tested Arduino drivers/libraries to create a scriptable LED Controller with WiFi access, web configuration, a web file editor (to edit the patterns), and a web (or serial) REPL to interact with the VM ‘live’. 

## Status
**NEOJS** right now is still very much in the ‘just hacked together’ … ‘prototype’ … ‘proof of concept’ …  

However, this is one of the objectives we are trying to demonstrate with this project. We want to show by adding a VM layer into an Arduino sketch not only changes the dynamics of the sketch, (by making it scriptable) while maintaining access to the vast collection of Arduino libraries and drivers available today. Quickly glue various 'Arduino Libraries' together and map them into a JavaScript VM.
