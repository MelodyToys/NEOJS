# NeoJS is a 'JavaScript' scriptable NeoPixel LED Controller with a easy to use Web UI

## What is NodeJS

#### For the End User - *(Release)*
  NeoJS is a ‘JavaScript’ scriptable NeoPixel LED Controller that can be used by beginners and experts to learn, test, prototype, and experiment with addressable LEDs and patterns. 

  NeoJS has an easy to use web UI accessible with a standard web browser over WiFi. With NeoJS there’s no need to install any software or hardware drivers on your computer or device. ‘Out-of-the-Box’ NeoJS has everything needed to connect, control, program, and edit files.

  NeoJS is an educational ‘Toy’ that can be used by educators to teach programming skills with a fun, interactive, easy to use platform. 

#### For the Developer - *(Source)*
  NeoJS is also a Arduino Sketch demonstrating the use of a script (VM) interpreter (Elk JavaScript) from within the Arduino Development Environment (IDE). NeoJS leverages the Arduino development environment and several well known and tested Arduino Drivers/Libraries to create a JavaScript scriptable NeoPixel LED Controller with WiFi Access, Web Configuration, a Web JavaScript Editor (to edit the patterns), and a ‘Live’ Web (or Serial) REPL to interact with the VM. 

## Status
Right now things are still very much in the ‘just hacked together’ … ‘prototype’ … ‘proof of concept’ … stages 

However, this is one of the points we are trying to demonstrate with this project . We want to show how by adding a VM layer into a Arduino sketch we not only change the dynamics of the sketch (by making it scriptable) but we’ll also maintain access to the vast collection of Arduino Libraries and Drivers available to rapidly prototype projects that  and interactively interface with it quickly.

## Why’s? And Why Not’s?
